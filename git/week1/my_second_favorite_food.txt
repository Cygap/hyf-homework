UNAGI NIGIRI

HOW TO MAKE IT
If the unagi is whole, use a sharp knife to cut it into equal pieces about 1" in diameter, about 10-12g each.

Wet your hands and form about 15g of the sushi rice into small oblong shaped pieces.

Place the grilled eel on top of the rice. Lightly brush the top of the eel with unagi sauce.

Take a strip of nori and wrap it around the middle.

Sprinkle toasted sesame seeds over the top of the eel.


Repeat with the remainder.
